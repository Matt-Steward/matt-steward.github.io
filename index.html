    <p>Having found myself furloughed I decided to embark on a programme of up-skilling and re-skilling (you know, the stuff you knew
        once but have forgotten due to a lack of use), and just generally playing with tech that interests me.
    </p>
    <p>As this generally involves building a POC, or at the very least a fiddle, I thought I'd consolidate these in once place, just 
        in case any are of use to others.
    </p>
    <p>I've split these into <a href="/blog">blog entries</a>, and occasionally longer <a href="/articles">articles</a> when needed.</p>
